## Overview

The Movie Recommendation Engine aims to provide personalized movie suggestions to users by analyzing their preferences and similarities with other users. The project leverages data extraction from IMDb using Beautiful Soup to gather information about movies such as title, genre, rating, and cast. This data is then used to train a recommendation model.

## Library Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Used for web scraping IMDb data.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilized libraries such as scikit-learn 
- **Streamlit**: Used for developing the user interface.

## Data Collection and Preparation

Data was collected from IMDb using Beautiful Soup. The following information was gathered for each movie:
- Title
- Genre
- Rating

The data was then cleaned and preprocessed to be used for training the recommendation model.

## Model Development

Several machine learning techniques were explored for building the recommendation engine, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. The final model was chosen based on its performance in providing accurate and relevant movie recommendations.

## User Interface

The user interface of the Movie Recommendation Engine is built using Streamlit. It allows users to input their movie preferences and get personalized movie suggestions.
